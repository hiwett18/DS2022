    "Readability of your code is very important, as much as writing your code efficiently. As described in the style documentation, a style guide is about consistency. Consistency is important when making your project, and even most important when making your modules and functions. The style document shows the correct and wrong way of doing indentation, naming package, module, class, and function, spacing, the correct way of importing and so on. The styling documentation also talks about when to make class methods and instances public and non-public. By convention it is better to set methods and instances non-public than making them public because it is better to change from non-public to public than the vice versa. Finally, the documentation gives programming recommendation how to use None in the if statement, using the lambda expression with def, and how to catch exceptions in a correct way.  "
